"$ARGUMENTS"

### Feature Description Validation
  - If empty or missing: "Error: Feature description is required. Please provide a detailed description of the feature you want to continue implementing."


## Process

### Step 1: Find Feature Worktree
Identify the appropriate worktree:
```bash
git worktree list
```

If worktree doesn't exist, check if feature branch exists and create worktree:
```bash
git branch -a | grep feature
# If local branch exists but no worktree:
git worktree add ./worktrees/FEATURE_NAME FEATURE_NAME
# If only remote branch exists:
git worktree add -b FEATURE_NAME ./worktrees/FEATURE_NAME origin/FEATURE_NAME
```

If couldn't find a right fit, stop and ask user for clarification.


### Step 2: Navigate to Feature Worktree
Tell user to switch to the worktree:
```bash
cd ./worktrees/FEATURE_NAME
```

### Step 3: Analyze Current Progress
1. Check if sync with origin/main is needed. if so- run /merge command.
2. Read current git state compared to origin/main to understand context
3. Examine `plan.md` and documentation
4. Identify next steps from the plan

### Step 4: Summarization
- Summarize next steps and ask user how to continue
