Creates a new feature branch using git worktree and starts work immediately. No planning, no tests, no docs - just MVP implementation.

## Feature description from user input
"$ARGUMENTS"

### Feature Description Validation
  - If empty or missing: "Error: Feature description is required. Please provide a brief description of what to build."

## Process

### Step 1: Create Worktree
Run /create-worktree command to set up isolated feature branch

### Step 2: Start Implementation
Begin MVP implementation immediately:
- Focus on minimal working version
- Skip tests, docs, and plan.md
- Build the core functionality only
- Iterate quickly with user feedback

**FROM NOW ALL NEW WORK SHOULD ONLY BE DONE IN THIS FEATURE DIR**
